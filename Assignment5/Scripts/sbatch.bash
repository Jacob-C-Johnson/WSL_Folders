# A bash script to run your experiments on the HPC
# This script provides an output file name
# runs on the compute nodes of the cluster (see the user guide)
# uses a single node
# has a single process on that node
# but we have 4 cpus available to run this task
# uses the ccu108 account number (it gets charged to this account)
# copy all environment variables over
# -t is the amount of time at most to run this job hours:minutes:seconds
# time is important so it kills the program if it accidentally breaks and keeps running
# time is also important because this program will be queued but will not run right away 
# because other people are running things right now (its busy)
# so the time you put helps the schedulder know when to start your script

# submit this job using the command: $ sbatch sbatch.bash
# it will reutrn the job id

# to know how long the job has been running: $ squeue -u <username> 
# and you can keep calling that command to see when it's done

# alternatively, use: $ watch squeue -u <username>
# for it to automatically refresh every 2 seconds

# when it's done running, it will create a .out file
# this file contains all of the print output (instead of it going to the screen)
